I originally got interested in programming from playing chess and wondering how the different chess computers work.  I first started learning Python because I am an engineer by degree, but I am currently learning JavaScript, Java, HTML, and CSS.  Since the start of my programming journey, I have followed many videos on YouTube on how to program different games within Python, and how to implement the min-max optimization computer players.  I have since completed a full stack bootcamp with Tech Elevator where I learned about REST APIs, databases in SQL, Vue.js, and Spring.  I hope to eventually learn more about machine learning as well as general software engineering practices.
